These are the scripts that I'm running on the lab computer. 
modelgen.sh is the master script. Calling bash modelgen.sh sheetname from the command line will run all the other scripts.
paramWriter.py reads a Google sheet and overwrites the variables onto an existing parameter file (modParameters.dat). 
You do not need to rewrite all the parameters for each model, only the ones that you want to change from the base file.
chi.py is the SED chi-squared test.
csvWriter.py is not complete. Right now it returns a CSV file with the name of the sheet and the SED chi-squared value.
In the future csvWriter.py should ideally update an existing spreadsheet so that all the chi-squared values are easily accessible.
I also need to integrate Jake's image chi-squared script, but that can wait while we explore the SED.
